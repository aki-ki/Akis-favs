    <h2>Guitar !!</h2>
    <p>
      It's really fun to learn my favourite songs and play along to them. I'm
      also in a band, and it's very rewarding to hear how good all the
      instruments sound together. I've been playing in a band for almost a year,
      and playing guitar for about 1.5 years. I'm not skilled enough to play
      some songs but I'm improving fast !

    <h2>My very cute amazing pets !!!!</h2>
    <h3>Tim ! (my cat)</h3>
    He is four or five (??) years old. He is very cuddly and soft. He's an
    outdoor cat, and whenever he's in the backyard we see his cat friends too!
    He has his own table downstairs for his food dishes. Whenever he's hungry,
    he knocks the dishes and whatever's in it off the table üòêüòêüòê but it's okay
    because he's cute.

    <h3>Millie !</h3>
    She's 10 or 11 years old but still acts like a puppy. She's very cute but
    she's a little stubborn, she barks at anyone she can. Even dogs 10x her
    size.

    <h3>Jennie!</h3>
    She's the youngest of them all. She is about 3 years old. She's very very
    shy and anxious to new people but the most playful and silly dog ever ! She
    loves to walk in circles around whoever is taking her on a walk and getting
    her leash all tangled up. üòê
